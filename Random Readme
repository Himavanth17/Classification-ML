1. Importing Libraries:
    
    ```python
    
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    
    ```
    
    These lines import necessary libraries:
    
    - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
    - `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting graphs (though not used in this script).
    - `numpy` for numerical operations.
2. Loading the Dataset:
    
    ```python
    
    df = pd.read_csv('Social_Network_Ads.csv')
    
    ```
    
    This line reads the CSV file `Social_Network_Ads.csv` into a pandas DataFrame named `df`.
    
3. Separating Features and Labels:
    
    ```python
    
    x = df.iloc[:,:-1].values
    y = df.iloc[:,-1].values
    
    ```
    
    These lines separate the features (input data) and the labels (output data):
    
    - `x` contains all columns except the last one.
    - `y` contains only the last column.
4. Splitting the Dataset:
    
    ```python
    
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=0)
    
    ```
    
    This line splits the dataset into training and testing sets:
    
    - 75% of the data is used for training (`x_train`, `y_train`).
    - 25% of the data is used for testing (`x_test`, `y_test`).
    - `random_state=0` ensures reproducibility of the split.
5. Feature Scaling:
    
    ```python
    
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    sc = StandardScaler()
    x_train = sc.fit_transform(x_train)
    x_test = sc.transform(x_test)
    
    ```
    
    These lines scale the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1:
    
    - `sc.fit_transform(x_train)` computes the mean and standard deviation on the training set and applies the transformation.
    - `sc.transform(x_test)` applies the same transformation to the test set.
6. Training the Random Forest Classifier:
    
    ```python
    
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10, criterion='entropy', random_state=0)
    classifier.fit(x_train, y_train)
    
    ```
    
    These lines import the Random Forest classifier and train it on the scaled training data (`x_train`, `y_train`):
    
    - `n_estimators=10` specifies that the model should use 10 trees in the forest.
    - `criterion='entropy'` specifies that the model should use entropy to measure the quality of splits.
    - `random_state=0` ensures reproducibility.
7. Making Predictions:
    
    ```python
    
    y_pred = classifier.predict(x_test)
    
    ```
    
    This line uses the trained classifier to predict the labels for the test set (`x_test`).
    
8. Evaluating the Model:
    
    ```python
    
    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
    print(cm)
    accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    
    ```
    
    These lines evaluate the model:
    
    - `confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)` computes the confusion matrix to see how well the predictions match the actual labels.
    - `accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)` computes the accuracy of the model.
